  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="content">
  <p>My name is Paul Santos. I received my education from Rutgers University with a bachelors in Biomedical Engineering.  Sounds exciting doesn't it?  After graduating, I started as a lab technician at a medical device company and worked my way up to become an engineer.  Turns out that I don't enjoy engineering as much as I thought I would.  One day my cousin told me about a startup idea that he had and asked me to work with him and build a site for him.  I began my journey on <a href="www.CodeAcademy.com"> CodeAcademy</a> and I was hooked.  I decided I needed guidance and enrolled in the <a href="http://codingbootcamp.rutgers.edu/learn-more/?utm_campaign=TC%20-%20Branded&utm_keyword=rutgers%20coding%20bootcamp&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&k=rutgers%20coding%20bootcamps=google">Rutgers Coding Bootcamp</a>.</p>

  <p>I was born in Staten Island, NY but grew up in New Jersey. (I still like to say I'm a New Yorker)</p>
  <p>I love to ride my motorcycles and pretend I'm Valentino Rossi.  I have owned a Ducati Monster, MV Agusta F3, and a Suzuki DRZ400sm.  My sports teams are the NY Knicks, NY Mets, NY Rangers.  I also like to box as a hobby.</p>
